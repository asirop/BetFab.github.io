Lyon trip to the SopraSteria Open!

On the 10th of June, students at ISIMA were invited to the SopraSteria Open. It’s a challenger tennis championship in Lyon. So, 4 of us were there! We were introduced to a team of Sopra Steria and attend to a couple of tennis matches.

It was the first time (but definitely not the least) I was in Lyon. We traveled by couch and we didn’t really have the time to visit. We caught a coffee at Starbucks and went straight to the Tennis Club. 

From there we waited the begining of the matchs with some Sopra Steria employees. They introduced us to the (..) compagny. Sopra Steria is a european tech compagny (...)

Then we attended to a presentation of the DigiLab and the iGirouette by two engineers(?) at the Sopra Steria stand. (Nao, iGirouette in Lyon ...)

They also presented us les “Trophées de L’Innovation de Sopra Stera” and the “Tuba”
(...)

For the rest of the day we caught sunburns watching tennis matchs. <photo du match> 
Is was a very fun day and I’m very glad to having being introduced (?) to this compagny. Thanks to them!
